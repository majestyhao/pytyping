PyTyping is a Python program for Linux that plays sounds when typing; by default, typewriter sounds. I wrote this because while such programs are available for Windows and Mac, I couldn't find a comparable application for Linux.

PyTyping can be used as auditory feedback for touch typing, or just because it sounds cool!

It is based off pyxhook, and requires python-xlib and gstreamer (see README for full dependency information).
